powaur \- an AUR helper with a pacman-like interface
.SH SYNOPSIS
.I powaur
<operation> [options] [targets]
.SH DESCRIPTION
powaur is an AUR helper which provides a pacman-like interface. Invoking
powaur involves specifying an operation with applicable options and targets.
.SH OPERATIONS
.TP
.B "-G, --getpkgbuild <package(s)>"
Download PKGBUILDS from the AUR. PKGBUILDS are downloaded as tarballs, then
extracted into the current working directory. Dependencies will be resolved
for the packages and if any dependencies are from the AUR, they will be
downloaded, with their dependencies resolved.
.IP
NOTE: For dependency resolution to work properly, the package names in the
PKGBUILDS must be exact.
.TP
.B "-Q, --query"
Query the pacman local database. This option lets you view information about
installed packages (eg. dependencies, provides, installed date). When no
packages are provided, all installed packages will be queried.
.TP
.B "-S, --sync"
Synchronize packages. When used with no options, at least one target is
required and powaur will attempt to install the target package(s) from the AUR.
Do note that powaur does NOT provide dependency resolution.

You are adviced to use the -G flag to download PKGBUILDS and review them
before installing them using makepkg.
