WHAT IS POWAUR?
---------------

powaur is an AUR helper written in C. Its main objective is to provide
a yaourt / pacman esque interface to the AUR.

Currently, powaur has a minimalistic feature set which allows you to:

- Search for packages on the AUR
- Query local and sync databases for package information
- Download packages from the AUR
- Install packages from the AUR (no dependency resolution)
- Backup your pacman local database

Unlike full featured AUR helpers such as clyde, powaur is not meant to
replace pacman. 


OBJECTIVES
----------

powaur provides an interface which is as close to that of yaourt and pacman
as possible, without sacrificing too much performance. After all, why learn
an additional set of commands when you are already familiar with one that
works? =)

powaur seeks to:

- provide an interface as similar to pacman as possible
- do things efficiently. Hence C is the language of choice


Inspiration for powaur has come from:

- cower
- pacman
- yaourt
- git


THE -S FLAG
-----------

Currently, the `-S` flag does not do any dependency resolution when it comes
to installing packages. What it does is:

- Downloads the tarball packages from the AUR
- Unzips them in `/tmp/powaur`
- Asks the user to edit the PKGBUILD (only vim for now, sorry)
- Invokes `makepkg -s` to install the package


A NOTE ABOUT THE AUR
--------------------

The Arch User Repository (AUR) is a community driven repository. As such,
AUR packages are unsupported and come with a certain level of security risk.

As such, use of the `-S` flag to install AUR packages is highly discouraged.
You are highly advised to look through the PKGBUILDS before invoking makepkg
to build the packages.
